## About

Cafe Providence is a web application that helps you find the best cafes in Providence, RI. With the most up-to-date cafe listings and reviews from Google Places API, we can help you find the perfect cafe for your next coffee break.

## Our Process

Coming to Providence, often known as the Seattle of the East Coast, we wanted to explore as many cafes as possible. With cafes ranging from espresso bars to matcha stands, there were too many choices and too little time to try them all. We decided to create a web application that would help us find the best cafes in Providence, RI, based on our preferences each day.

We were also inspired by applications like Beli and Yelp, which help users find the best restaurants and cafes in their area. We wanted to create a similar application that would help users find the best cafes in Providence, RI, but at a more local and personal level.
